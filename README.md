# py-project

This a project for a gaming cafe management system . Made in python .

Here , for players coming to the cafe they need to enter their details and choose a
system on which they want to play on .

And for the owner of the cafe , I have set the work admin can do i.e.
either add record , delete record or display record .

Sql connectivity has been set up in the program to store the record .

This is my first official python project... THANK YOU
